            It's All Over - Again is a hybrid publication with analyses and reflections on digital-analog hybrid art experiences in a post-covid digital reality. It consists of a collection of conversations and written essays with and by creators, critics and curators. It is prompted by the many opportunities that hybrid making practices and hybrid presentations offer to the sector and have not yet been sufficiently discovered. Now that the forced necessity of offering some online programs seems a thing of the past, it is time to reflect on exciting examples we have seen from before, during and after the pandemic. We want to explore what makes a hybrid artwork successful.

            During the pandemic, we ourselves were rarely surprised. We noted that there was a lot of repetition of previous examples from new media and internet art. Our suspicion, rooted in our own experience working in art education, is that this recent history of art is still not taught enough in art education, leaving a young generation of creators unaware of the possibilities and examples from the short history of digital art.

            It's All Over - Again is aimed at young professionals in the creative industry as well as students and teachers at all art and design schools (especially focusing on the traditional, analogue, craft studies). By collaborating with Fontys Hogeschool voor de Kunsten, a large interdisciplinary educational institution, we want to contribute to increasing the interest and knowledge of digital media and hybrid art in (art) education. The title, 'It's All Over - Again' refers to the continuous debate in the digital art discourse around terminology from net.art to internet art, post-internet and post-digital art.  Now that we've added 'hybrid art' to the list of attempts to take digital art seriously as an art form, it's time to reflect again. Because digital art, or whatever you want to call it, is too important to be pushed away and forgotten by digital fatigue.
